## Risks

At this point in the course, we've already mentioned the word risk a few times, but I wanted to dive into it in a little bit more detail in this lesson.

Risk refers to a possible event that could cause harm, loss, or make it more difficult to achieve your objectives. Essentially, it's any possible event that could impact our ability to co-create that value through our services.

Generally, when most people think of risk and service management, they think about it from a new insallation or a project perspective. But risk is also present in the form of our services too.

From a service provider perspective, our goal is to minimize risk for our customers who use our services. In this way, risks are similar to costs. But just like costs, our customers will assume that some new risk is going to occur as part of their consumption of our services.

For example, if we go back to my Uber example where I was a customer using the app to get rides all over San Francisco, I removed the risk of not finding a parking space for my rental car since the service removed my need for me to have my own rental car in the first place.

However, I now run the risk of not being able to call an Uber if the app malfunctions. Or, what if I'm in an area where there's no cellular service? Or, what if my phone battery dies? All of these are new risks that are introduced into my desired outcome of traveling around San Francisco.

Now as a consumer of the service, I can also contribute to reducing the risk by taking some mitigating actions. For example, I can carry around a spare battery pack with me. By doing this as a consumer, I am reducing the risk that I won't be able to call for an Uber when I need one because of my battery dying. At the same time, I might also communicate to Uber that I'm finding it difficult to use their service in more rural areas. Maybe when I'm outside the city, I'm not getting enough Uber drivers in that area. By more clearly articulating my needs and my requirements, then the service provider can determine if they're able to better meet them.

Maybe Uber is going to decide that they're going to pay a premium or a bonus to their drivers who will work in those more rural areas outside the city center. That might increase the number of drivers on those streets and make it easier for customers to get a ride.

Now as a consumer, it's up to me to clearly communicate my needs to that service provider and to clarify the outcomes that I want to achieve. I also need to make sure I'm communicating any constraints or critical success factors that I may have for that service. 

This means I'm putting requirements on that service provider, right? Well, guess what? This service provider may also put requirements on me as a customer too. In the example of Uber, they require me to have a cell phone, a valid data plan, and the ability to send my GPS location to their drivers by using the location tracking feature on my phone.

This is a two way street after all. We're both working to co-create the value and reduce the overall risk. Now, since risk is a possible event that could cause harm or make it more difficult for us to achieve our objectives, we can do some things to mitigate that risk.

Well, what are those things that we can do?There's actually 4 things we can do with risk.

* We can avoid risk
* We can accept risk
* We can transfer risk
* We can mitigate risk.

Now, when we __avoid__ risk, we're aiming to actually remove it completely from the service. Now, in reality, we can't remove all the risk for a service because risk is something that's inherent in everything that a business does to some level in some degree.

But, there are certain risks that we can avoid completely. For example, let's say that you're running a service that allows people to read your blog. Maybe you're worried about the new privacy regulations and don't want to have to worry about maintaining all of the blog reader's information securely and properly under the new GDPR provisions.

Well, you could avoid those issues completely if you turn off tracking on your reader's information by disabling any cookies, and you can also remove any requests for their email addresses and other things like that. If you're not collecting their information, you no longer have to protect that information.

Now, this may not be the best business decision, right because most businesses want to be able to track their customers and contact them by email with offers. So, while you can avoid this whole situation, it's probably better if we found a better way to handle this risk.

And that brings us to simply __accepting__ the risk. With this option, you look at the cost of protecting against the risk and you look at the possible bad outcomes and determine that it's simply cheaper to pay to accept the risk and pay up if you're going to get caught.

Now, going back to our privacy example, I have a friend who is in an Australian based company, which is outside of the European Union. Because of this, he's taken the position that he's not worried about complying with the GDPR policies because he's an Australian living in Australia and he has an Australian company.

He isn't actively targeting European customers, but if they happen to go to his site, too bad. He's calculated the risk and he believes the risk is low that the EU is going to try to fine him or even collect if they do. So he's taken no actions in regard to changing the way his website works or the way his business works. He's going to do it the exact same way he did before GDPR to the way it is after GDPR. Now, this is called risk acceptance.

Now, the next thing we could do is we can instead decide to __transfer__ the risk. Maybe you don't want to be responsible for collecting and storing all this private information, but you still want access to that data. Well, in that case you can hire a service provider to collect it for you, to store it securely, and to give you access. This would be a form of risk transfer. 

Another option might be that you take the approach that my Australian friend did and he simply is going to pay some insurance in case you get sued or fined. This transfers the risk to the insurance company because you paid them a monthly premium to take that risk on for you. 

Our final option with risk is what's most commonly used. It's known as risk __mitigation__. With risk mitigation, we put in place some actions to reduce the risk even if it doesn't eliminate it completely.

In our privacy data example, we may add new technology systems that are going to better protect the data and implement new processes in the way that we handle the data. This will help us reduce the risk and hopefully make the information much more secure, which is one of the intended outcomes of GDPR anyway.

But, a hacker can still break into our network and steal all of the customers' data. If this happens, we might have reduced the risk but we didn't eliminate the risk.

That's the idea of risk mitigation.
