## Governance

In this lesson we're going to briefly revisit the concept of governance. And you see it here inside the service value system. It's going to be part of that internal piece that takes our opportunities and our demands, works it through that middle of the service value system to come out the other side as value.

Now what is governance? Well governance is the means by which an organization is directed and controlled.

I used the example earlier, if you think about your government, like the US Congress, they do governance. They provide the laws and regulations that the rest of the company will follow. Well inside of your organization, you run governance as well. 

Governance may be set up by those in the C-suite, your CEO, your CFO, your CIO, your CSO or other high level executives.

You're going to come up with the way the organization is going to be directed and controlled and then pass that down through governance down to things like guidelines and regulations and standards.

ITIL at its core is a framework for governance. But it's not a directive framework for governance. It's not going to tell you that you have to follow everything the way that ITIL say it is. ITIL instead is a best practice and you can write your governance based on ITIL. 

Now when we look at governance at a large macro-level in your organization, it's the way you're going to do things. You may come up with processes and activities and procedures for how you're going to handle something like change management. Every time you want to have a new server installed it's got to go through this process that has 15 different steps and these many different approvals at this level. That is part of governance.

The way you're going to control and organize and direct your organization. That's the whole concept. So if you think about governance like laws but within your organization, that's kind of the big concept of it. And it is part of this service value system because that governance is what you're going to build your processes and your activities around to make sure their inline with the governances you put out at that high level of your organization.
