Service relationships, this is what being a service provider is all about.

To create value, an organization has to provide more than just a service. They have to work with their consumers and their customers to build an ongoing relationship.

Now, in the business world, just as in our love life, relationships are challenging and sometimes difficult. In this lesson, we're going to take a look at what a service relationship is and why it can be so complicated.  First, let's cover the definition of a service relationship.

A service relationship is a cooperation between the service provider and a service consumer that includes service provision, service consumption and service relationship management. This is a fairly straight forward concept. Basically, it's when two organizations want to work together, they have a relationship that's formed. During this relationship, one of these organizations might assume the role of the service provider and the other becomes the consumer.

Right now, you and I have a service relationship. I'm the service provider and you're the consumer of the training service that we're offering. But like I said, it can be much, much more complicated than that. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself here. Let's first talk about service provision. What is service provision?

Well, service provision is the activities that are performed by an organization to provide the services. This includes things like managing the service provider's resources, configuring them to deliver the service, providing access to the resources to the users and fulfilling the agreed upon service actions, as well as conducting service level management and even performing continual improvement to their services. Service provision can even include supplying goods to the consumer as well.

Now, let's consider when you go and buy a new cell phone from your cell phone service provider. You walk into the store and they give you a phone, which is good, and they activate your phone by giving you a brand new phone number and this is actually called account provisioning. This establishes your new user account, your new phone number in this case. And they assign different features, such as voicemail and text messages and a data plan and other things to your account. By the time they're done, you can walk out of the store with your new phone, your new phone number and working cellular service.

That is all service provisioning by your service provider. Now, when you walk out the door, you're going to use your new cell phone and now, you're going to become a consumer who's beginning to do what is known as service consumption. Service consumption includes all the activities performed by an organization or a single person in the case of your new cell phone, and this is going to allow you to consume those new services. Service consumption includes things like the management of the consumer's resources that are needed to use the service, such as you paying your bill every month to make sure the service stays working, as well as all the other actions you perform to utilize the provider's resources, such as checking your email or making phone calls on your new smartphone. Or it can even be requesting new service actions to be fulfilled.

For example, you might be getting ready to fly from one country to another and you need your service provider to enable data roaming on your phone. This, again, is one of those things that can happen inside of service consumption. When the consumer is doing something, this is called service consumption. 

Now, in addition to service provisioning and service consumption, there are some activities that are done by both the service provider and the service consumer and when they do these things together, they're trying to enable value co-creation to occur based upon the agreed and available service offerings.

This is known as service relationship management. The most basic of the things here are things like having the consumer paying their bill on time, so their monthly subscription doesn't get canceled and the service doesn't get turned off.

Or it may be that the service provider needs to ensure they're communicating with the consumer about a possible network outage that's going to occur because this weekend there's going to be a server upgrade. This back and forth communication is what we call service relationship management. So, now that we know a little bit about service relationships, including service provisioning, service consumption and service relationship management, let's dig in to the complicated portion of this topic, the *service relationship model*.

As I said, business can be complicated and because of this, we have to consider the different relationships that are involved in any single service. For example, let's consider [my website](https://diontraining.com/). We offer training services over video to our students, students just like you.

Now, if you're watching this video on https://diontraining.com/, that means there are a lot of different service relationships that have already occurred behind the scenes to enable that to happen.

Let's place you in the Organization __D__ spot here on the far right. Now, you want to watch this video, but for that to happen, the video has to get to you. Well, that happens because you have a service relationship in place with our company. In this relationship, you are the consumer and we are the service provider. Well, to make this work, we rely on service providers as well. We don't host our own videos, for example, but instead we outsource that to a very large video streaming company with cloud servers all over the world to ensure that you get the best quality with the lowest latency.

Let's put them up here as Organization __B__. Now, in the relationship between Dion Training and the video streaming company, we are the consumer and the video streaming company is the service provider, but that video streaming service we used, they don't even own their own servers. No, instead they rely on Google Cloud. And that means the video streaming service is actually a consumer, too.

Well, Google is going to be their service provider, but to make it even more complicated, there are departments inside of Google that work on IT systems. Well, some of those people are actually members of my website and they take this very same training that you're in right now. And so, when you're logged into my website to watch those videos, they're now going to be the consumers and I'm the service provider once more.

You can see how this interrelationship can get really messy and really complicated. The bottom line here is I want you to realize that in most cases, organizations are going to be both a service provider to someone and as service consumer themselves.

This is what this diagram is showing with just these four companies we discussed in this example. If I was going to draw out every relationship for every service offering within my company, I would have to fill 100 or more of these screens because of all of the different relationships we have, and we're just a small company.

If you think about how messy this would be for somebody like Facebook or LinkedIn or Microsoft or Google. It can just blow your mind. So, for the exam, I want you to remember, your organization may be a service provider or a service consumer or it can be both.

It all depends on the scenario and the service relationships that are involved.
