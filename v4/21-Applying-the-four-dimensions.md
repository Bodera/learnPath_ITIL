## Applying the four dimensions

So now that we've covered all four dimensions and the external factors throughout this section, I want to put it all together in a real world example, to really drive the point home of how these all work together.

So we talked about our four dimensions, organizations and people, information and technology, partners and suppliers, and value streams and processes. As well as those six external factors that all are focused in how we look at our products and services to co-create value with our consumers.

Well let's consider the process of incident management. How are we going to deal with incident management when something happens to our service or our product? Well, if we look at it through the organizations and people lens or that dimension, we're going to ask the question of - How we're going to organize our teams?

Is this something the service desk is going to handle? Are we going to have different tiers? Like Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 support? Or are we going to have a flat organization?

These are all things we have to figure out. How're we going to organize our communications? How is that Tier 1 representative going to transfer the information they collected to the Tier 2 representative if you're going to use a tiered or vertical organization? How're you going to escalate it up to the next level?

At which trip points? How about the people you need? How're you going to decide how many people you need to run the incident management for a particular service? What competencies do they need? Is this service going to be something that uses AWS, do you need Amazon Web Service certified people? Or is this going to be something that we're goin to use local services?

How about the qualifications? How about the way they're going to interact? How are you going to motivate the people? How are you goin to hire the right people? How are you goin to keep the right people? How are you goin to pay them? And how are you going to make sure that they're capable of doing the incident management that you want them to do?

All of these are things you have to think about from the organizations and people lens, or perspective, or dimension. Now when I look at from the information and technology side, let's think about it from the process standpoint. 

How am I going to register the incident? Am I writing it down on a piece of paper? Am I putting it in a internet portal? Am I using a certain piece of software or hardware to do that? How about the relationship between incidents? How do I know that this incident with this printer, that happened today, is related or not related to the one that happened three weeks ago?

Well maybe I have some kind of technology or information management software that does that for me. That can track the incidents in the problems. Or the incidents and the particular configuration item, meaning that printer. Or the incidents and the different users who were being affected.

Maybe when we get all of these calls and we put them together, we find that all of the users affected, always added Building 1 and not in Building 2. So maybe it's a problems with Building 1. And so we can look into that, right?

How about incident management tools for information flow. How're we going to do work flow? How're we going to use knowledge bases? How about diagnostic tools? How're we going to detect these events, and process these events? How're we going to communicate with each other? How're we going to organize and share data?

All of this is stuff that goes under that information part of the information and technology portion of this dimension.

Then we get to our third dimension. And we start looking at our partners and suppliers, right? Because nobody is self sufficient, we talked about this before. Maybe this printer is broken because it ran out of supplies, maybe there's no more paper, maybe there's no more toner, right?

So those are things that we have to think about. We think about partners and suppliers, we have to think about the external teams that are going to contribute to the success of our service. Maybe in this case, we have outsourced completely the management of the printers, and that company is not doing a good job. And so we need to evaluate their contract.

If we outsource a service, how're we going to escalate incidents to them once something is broken? Or maybe we escalate top tier service. So we handle minor incidents in house, but we're going to outsource those major incidents and so we have to escalate it to them. How do we get information back from them when they fix something, right?

Is a two way street between partners and suppliers and us. All of this is things we have to think about and we start considering how're we going to operate with our partners and suppliers, right?

And then we have our final dimension to look at. Which is going to be our value streams and our processes.

Maybe we look at that value stream and see that this whole process of printing, actually has issues with it, because it's not optimized properly. There's too much waste in it. Maybe we've looked at it and we said " Y'know what, we can take out step number two and just make it step one and three and four and that will solve the problem." All of those things are things that we would've evaluate as we look at it from the four dimensions.

And then finally, we might want to look at it from those external perspectives. One of those, the E, stood for environmental. Maybe we have somebody who doesn't like the fact that we're printing and wasting a bunch of trees by printing out a lot of stuff.

And so somebody might've jammed the printer on purpose to break it, because they are an environmentalist, right? That's kind of crazy, but you kind of get the idea of what I'm talking about. We can start thinking about all of these four dimensions and these external factors and how they're going to effect a simple service, something like printing or something like an incident management.

And as we look at this, that's how all of this ends up tying together. And that's the whole idea of using these four dimensions. When you're thinking about your processes, your people, your organization, your technology, your information, all of that stuff, so you can make sure that your products and services are delivering the value that they are suppose to.
