## Start Where You Are

Our second guiding principle is to start where you are. This is a really important guiding principle because whenever you get into an organization, even if you're a brand new hire, they already have existing processes and services in place and if you're brought onboard to help improve that through an improvement initiative, you have to remember that we don't want to start with a blank slate each time. We want to start where we are.

If I had you come in and I hired you to figure out the best way to create a new service or process to do voucher fulfillment for my students, every time somebody comes to our website to buy an exam voucher, you would have to look at the way the current process is done. Then you can figure out what is the better way to do it, right? But if you don't start with where we currently are, and you just start from a blank slate, you're going to spend a lot of time and resources doing stuff that isn't the way that we currently do it.

And there's probably some amount of value in the way we currently do it. So whenever you're engaged in an improvement initiative, I don't want you to start over without first looking at what is already available to be leveraged, because something there is probably valuable.

Now when you have a decision on how to proceed, you have to think about this based on the accurate information that's obtained through your direct observation supported by appropriate and effective measurement.

Again, if I have you come in, you're going to look at the way we currently do voucher fulfillment. If you looked at us about a year ago, the way we did it was a student would buy it through our shopping cart on our website, that would send an email to me, I would then go and order the voucher, take that voucher, put it in an email, and email it back to the student. It was a very manual process.

Now if you came in and looked at that, you'd say, - "Hey, I can make this a lot better. I can automate this. We can do five or six different ways of doing this process."

But if you looked at the way we were doing it, you'd at least know the proper steps that need to be included, which was we had to buy the voucher from Axelos, we then had to give that voucher to our student, and we had to collect money from our students for that voucher.

So we'd have to figure out what those steps are. By figuring out what the current steps are and how fast it is or how slow it is or what pain points there are, you can then overcome them as you're trying to go forward, and some of those parts of starting where you are are useful.

Some of those you're going to decide aren't useful and you'll push them away. All of this is done by measuring what you have, and measurements should be used to support your analysis of what you're observing rather than just simply replacing it.

Not everything can be measured with zeros and ones and numbers. Some things in data analytics, we rely on way too much and we oversee some of the basic things that we should be observing with our own eyes. Again, if you came in and looked at our voucher process, it was very simple, right? But that worked when we started out because we were selling maybe two vouchers a week. Now we're selling a lot of vouchers a week, and if we had to do that all manually it wouldn't work. The timeline to deliver to our students would take way too long, so instead we've looked at that using measurement, we've gotten our time down where now we deliver a voucher in about five minutes, and a lot of it is automated. 

Now there's still some parts of the process that are still manual, but that's just because of the way that those systems operate, and we're going through and we're constantly improving that to reduce that time down to give a better value and experience for our customers.

Now, the act of measuring can affect your results and this is something that's important to think about because as you go through and you try to measure everything that's currently going on, sometimes the people you're measuring will change the way they're working because they know they're being watched.

This happens a lot inside the service desk area. If you're doing something like measuring how quickly a call is resolved, what you'll start seeing is that your first level agents will close out trouble tickets even before things are solved for your consumers. That means that your measurement is going to go up, saying, -"Oh, look how quickly we've been able to resolve all these calls.", but in reality your customers aren't getting the value they want because their calls aren't being resolved.

I've seen this even at some places like drive-through restaurants. If you've ever gone through a McDonald's, they have a counter and they have a measurement of 30 seconds to deliver the food to you in your car to get you on the road again. But if they can't get that, what do they do? The tell you to pull off to a parking spot so they can mark your order as complete, and that way their timer stops, even though you still haven't gotten your food and that way they can help the next person. You may be sitting there for 10 minutes to get your food. Because they know they're being measured, that's going to affect the results because they're going to cheat the system.

Now when you set measurements, another thing I want you to think about is that when the measurement becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure, that's the Goodhart's Law. Going back to that McDonald's example. If I say every car has to get their food within 30 seconds and that becomes the target, we're no longer trying to give good food or good value to the customer.

Instead we're just trying to get them in and out within 30 seconds. So that is something you have to be wary of. Measurement is great in business. We use measurement a lot. But you want to make sure you're measuring the right things and it's not the target in and of itself. You're measuring things to determine if you're making progress towards the outcome that you really want.

We talked about that before when we talked about measuring outputs versus measuring outcomes. This is an important concept to remember. When we talk about starting where you are, how do we really apply this guiding principle? 

First I want you to look at what exists as objectively as possible. You may come into a new place and they say, -"You're going to come in because our current service management system sucks. It's bad, it's horrible, so we're hiring you as the new manager. Come in and overhaul the place.". You may come in and your first thing you want to do is just delete everything they have and start over. Please resist that urge.

Instead look at what is there, figure out what is useful and what you can build upon. You can determine if there are successful practices or services in place that can be replicated or expanded across the organization, and you can determine the things that are not successful and those things that need to be changed or deleted or removed.

You want to be applying your risk management skills here in your decision making progress because if we decide to just throw everything away and start from the beginning, we're going to spend a lot more time and assume a lot more risk because it is a lot easier to fix something than it is to create something new.

Also you should recognize that sometimes nothing from the current state can be reused, and you are going to simply have to create a blank slate. Now when you're going to do that, you're going to have to think about the way to make that transition happen. A good example of that is my current website.

As we're filming this video we're actually going through a major website redesign and overhaul, and it's not just a redesign of the website itself and how it looks and feels, but all of the underlying services are being rebuilt from the ground up. The current provider we were on was great when we had just a couple of hundred students, but as we've grown they can't support the demand anymore and their processes just don't work well for the long-term vision of our company.

So instead we're building a brand new system from the ground up. We have a brand new operating system, brand new servers, a brand new cloud provider, and we've built the entire application layer that does the course delivery ourself.

All of that means we've taken a huge amount of risk because we're migrating from something that we know works into something that we're trying to make work. So because of that we have to use proper risk management and do mitigations. One of those is we broke up the phase deployment of moving things over in pieces, so as we brought up the new site we brought over the homepage first but we didn't bring over the shopping cart and we didn't bring over the content and lesson delivery.

Next we're bringing over the shopping cart pieces, making sure that all works, and then we're going to bring over the big bulk which is our learning management system. We're doing this over a two or a three month period in very deliberate phased approaches, and by the time we're done most of what we had on the old site is not going to be reused. It's going to be thrown away because a lot of that doesn't apply on the new systems and the new services we've built.

So that sometimes is where you're going to be, but I would implore to you always think about what can be reused from the current system to the old system. In our case, a lot of our old training was able to be brought over. Our practice exams were able to be brought over. Our PDFs and our videos were able to be brought over. So we didn't have to recreate 20 classes again. But a lot of the services and the support that underlaid that system is being rebuilt again from a blank slate because that could not be reused. As you go through your organizations, you need to think about:

1. What can I reuse 
2. When I start from
3. Where I am 
4. What do I need to start over on?

That's the guiding principle that we use as our second guiding principle.
