## Resultados (Outcomes) 

Back when we discussed the definition of a service, we said that a service was a means of enabling value co-creation by facilitating outcomes
 that a customer wants to achieve without the customer having to manage the specific costs and risks.

Now in this lesson, we're going to dig into a single word from that definition, the word outcome. An outcome is a result for a stakeholder enabled
 by one or more outputs. This is focused on the customer's desired outcome, not the service provider's though, and this is important to understand.

Now, outcomes are important to consider as part of the balancing act between the supported outcomes, the removal of costs, and the removal of risks
 against unwanted or undesirable outcomes, the cost, and the risk that could be introduced by the customer if they decide to instead set up
 and manage their own resources.

Now, let's consider an example of what we're really discussing here. In my local area, we have two major ride-sharing companies that operate, we 
 have Uber and we have Lyft. Now, whichever you prefer here really doesn't matter, but I tend to take Uber more often than Lyft myself. Now, I 
 really like these ride-sharing services, especially when I'm traveling to a large downtown area for a conference or a convention or when I need
 to get from the airport to my house or something like that. Now, as a customer, I have a desired outcome. I want to get from point A to point B 
 in the least amount of time with a fair amount of cost.

For example, the last trip I took to San Francisco, I didn't even need to rent a car because I simply used Uber and Lyft to get from the airport to
 my hotel and from my hotel to various locations around the city that I needed to go to for my work. Now, this allowed me to get the outcome that I
 desired, which was getting from point A to point B in less time and with less hassle. Now, because I used the Uber app, I was able to reduce my 
 overall costs because I didn't need to have a rental car. I didn't need to spend $75 per night to park that rental car at my hotel and I didn't need
 to buy gas for that rental car.

I didn't need to purchase insurance for the rental car. You're getting the idea here. I was able to remove a lot of the costs because as a customer, 
 I simply paid for the service every time I needed it and I was able to achieve my desired outcome, getting from point A to point B. Now, if we consider
 the risks involved, I was able to reduce some of my risk as well. For example, I tend to find it very difficult to park in large cities, especially near
 the areas of town that I need to visit for a work trip. So when I used Uber, I could eliminate the risk of not finding adequate parking when I got to my
 desired location. Instead, I just get out of the car and I'm there. I also eliminated the risk of somebody stealing my rental car while it's parked or 
 breaking into it and stealing my luggage.

All those type of things are eliminated and it's no longer a risk for me. Now, I think you're starting to get the idea here. There's lots of different 
 costs and lots of different risks that can be reduced if you're using a service and I can gain the benefits of the service as a customer by using this
 ride-sharing app instead of renting my own car whenever I travel to a big city. Now conversely though, I need to balance this with the other side of the
 equation.

There's certain costs and risks that I'm assuming by choosing to use Uber or Lyft instead of renting my own car. First, there's cost imposed upon me by the
 service provider. Beyond the actual service cost to get from point A to point B, there's also a requirement that I maintain a smartphone to run the app and
 I have to ensure that I have a data plan on that smartphone and I have to make sure that my smartphone has enough battery power. All of this are things that
 have to happen so that I can connect the app from my phone to their central server in order to order that Uber to my location and have them pick me up. Now,
 this goes back to our original point about value, right? Value is co-created and a service is all about co-creating value by facilitating those outcomes that
 the customer wants to achieve without the customer having to manage the specific costs and risks of that service. 

So, as a customer of this ride-sharing service, I need to co-create the value of the service by having a smartphone and an active data plan and enough battery
 power to run it. Now, Uber on the other hand, needs to ensure that all the other technical details of the service are taken care of. They're going to provide 
 the servers that enable the service, they're going to enable the technology and the software coding, all of that other stuff. 

Now, I mentioned that the customer doesn't want to manage the specific costs and risks. What risk might there be with using an Uber instead of having your own
 rental car? Well, I've had an occasion or two where I've had to wait for my Uber to arrive because there's none in the area, and sometimes this'll take me 10
 or 15 minutes. Now, if I'm running a really tight schedule, there's a risk that I can miss my meeting. There's also a risk that a driver just isn't in the area
 when I need one. And so if you happen to go to a city center where there's a lot of Ubers and you travel to a location in the suburbs where there's not a lot 
 of Ubers, well this can become a problem when you're trying to get a ride back to the city. This is a risk that you're going to assume. If you had a rental car,
 you wouldn't have this risk, because you could simply jump in the car, turn the key, and start driving. 

Now as we have these costs and risks that the service has now imposed upon me, as their customer, I now have to decide whether I should ultimately use their 
 service or say it's not worth the effort and I'll simply rent a car and drive myself around. Now, this is the idea that we're all going to be thinking about
 when we think about a service, whether we're the one using the service or the one providing the service. That decision is going to be based on value. 
All of this comes back to value. If the value's being co-created to achieve the supported outcomes, then the removal of the costs and the removal of risk has to
 be greater than the unintended consequences. And if that's true, the introduction of these new costs or the introduction of new risks has to be balanced and 
 shifted in the favor of the consumer if you want them to buy the service from the service provider. In this case, ordering an Uber or a Lyft instead of renting a car.

It's all just about balancing this value, right? If we're the service provider, or a service provider organization like Uber in this case, we need to make sure 
 that we're giving more value and removing more costs and risks than we're introducing, and this way, the customer will want to use it. Now, in order for the 
 customer to see the value that we're generating, this has to be true. It has to tip the scales towards the customer side. Now, as the service provider, we want to
 make sure we're getting value in this, too. If we're the customer, we need to make sure that we're not creating additional costs or risks for ourselves that outweigh
 the benefits of the service that we're going to consume. So, if I'm going to go ahead and outsource my servers, I want to make sure that it's cheaper for me to do that
 and provides me more value for me to do that than just to simply run the servers myself.

Now, each personal organization is going to weigh, the value proposition and they're going to determine if it makes sense for them. If it does, were going to have a
 valid business agreement and we're going to be able to go into business together. You're going to provide me a service and I'm going to pay you to do that as the 
 consumer or the customer. So, going back to my example of Uber or Lyft, I find it works great for me when I'm traveling in a big city where the parking prices tend
 to be very high, the traffic tends to be heavy, and the number of drivers around is quite abundant so it's easy for me to get a Lyft or an Uber when I need one.

But when I travel to more remote locations, I prefer to have my own rental car because it solves the problem for me much more efficiently because there's less risk of 
 me not finding a parking space, because parking is low-cost in those areas and traffic is less of an issue because I'm outside  the city center. This is the whole idea
 of balancing those pros and those cons so we can make the idea  and figure out what gives us the most value. 

So, we've talked a lot about outcomes so far in all of these examples, but there's also a similar concept known as output that it's important to understand when you 
 take the exam. An output is a tangible or intangible deliverable or an artifact that's created by an activity. Now, for the exam you have to understand the difference
 between an output and an outcome. Services facilitate outcomes through one or more outputs. So, what does that mean? Well, an output could be a report, it could be a 
 bill that you receive at the end of the service that you've consumed, or it can even be an email if you're using a webmail service. All of these things are considered outputs.

They're that tangible item that comes out of using that service. Now, I like to think about this in a more tangible way, though. Consider this course. When I'm writing and 
 filming this lesson, the output is the final video that you're watching right now, but this isn't the outcome, it's just the output. So if the video isn't the outcome, what is?
Well, it's the desired value that you're trying to achieve from this video.

In the case of this video and the others in this course, the outcome for a student like you is to be able to pass your ITIL 4 Foundation exam.

If you're able to do that after watching these videos, then you've achieved the outcome that both you and I have desired. This is an important concept and one that people often
 confuse because the output is easily measured, but often the outcomes are not. It's easy for me to create an outline and list all of the videos that we're going to produce for 
 this course.

We can say, for example, there's going to be 100 videos in this course and if I've already filmed 12 of those videos, then I'm 12% complete with creating this course, and so I 
 have outputted 12% of the product.

Now, this is measuring outputs though, right? It's not measuring outcomes. Do we know that 100 videos is the right number to help you as a student? Get from the beginning to 
 the end and pass the exam? Well, if the outcome we want to achieve is a student passing, then 100 videos might not be the right measure. Maybe it only takes 25 videos
 or maybe it takes 200 videos.

We'll have to figure that out and measure that as we go. And as we figure out what things are working, what things aren't, we add or we remove to the course to make sure that our
 students are always going to be able to pass the exam. Now, output is part of an outcome, but there's more to it than just outputs. So, when you think of outcomes, I want you to
 remember that it's what you're able to achieve as a result of the activity. As a result of this interaction. Not just the outputs that are being created. Going back to my Uber 
 and Lyft example, the outcome is me getting across town and to my meeting on time because of the service provided by those companies.

The outcomes of taking this course isn't to say that you sat here and watched 100 videos for X number of hours or whatever it happens to be. But instead, it's focused on you passing the exam.
 That's the outcome that both you and I want to achieve here. Now, because of this, outcomes can be a bit more intangible, where outputs tend to be much more tangible. They're things 
 you can touch and feel like papers and reports and things like that. It also means that outputs are easier to measure because they're the results of an activity. So, when building your 
 service metrics, be careful not to measure just outputs, but instead, you need to put some thought behind how you're going to measure, your outcomes as well, because otherwise,
 you're going to have people working for you that game the system.

They're going to be pushing different things to make it look like all those outputs are really high, but you're never going to achieve the outcomes you want. So really think about 
 that as you're building those metrics and be sure to measure your outcomes, not just your outputs.
