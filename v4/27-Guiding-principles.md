## The Guiding Principles

In this section of the course, we're going to take a look at the seven guiding principles in ITIL 4. Now this is important because on the exam there are two exam objectives that are going to cover these seven guiding principles.

The first is to describe the nature, use, and interaction of these seven guiding principles. And the second objective is to explain the use of these seven different guiding principles.

And this is important because we're not going to have to memorize those guiding principles necessarily, or figure out what their definition is. But we're actually going to have to explain and describe, which is a level two level of effort inside the exam.

So if I give you a scenario and I explain what one of these guiding principles is, you should be able to pick out and say this guiding principle relates to that scenario. Now, before we go and dig into all of that we have to go and think about what is a guiding principle?

Well, a guiding principle is a a recommendation that's going to guide an organization in all circumstances.

That's right, guiding principles can be used to guide an organization in their work as they adopt a service management approach and adapt ITIL guidance to their own specific needs and circumstances.

This means that all organizations are going to integrate the use of multiple different methods into their overall approach to service management. The way you do service management and the way I do service management might be different. But, we both should be based on the same guiding principles. Because these guiding principles are applied universally to every initiative out there.

Now when we talk about applying those guiding principles, these guiding principles are going to help us to encourage and support our organizations in their continual improvement across all levels of the organization.

These, as I said, are applied universally to all of the initiatives, but also to all of the relationships with your different stake holder groups. So as we talk about the consumers and the customers and the stakeholders across the organization, all of these people need to be considered when you're thinking about these guiding principles.

For example, the first guiding principle is known as focus on value.

Now with focus on value it can, and should be applied, to all of your relevant stakeholders and respective definitions of value. We're not going to just consider the value for the consumer, but we also want to look at it from the value for the customer. We want to look at it for the value for the service provider. All of those different people and stakeholders need to be getting value from whatever the service is we're doing.

And so that's a way that we look at this stuff, for example as we're looking at the focus on value principle. Now, as an organization I'm not going to use just one or two of these principles. But I should consider all seven of them, and determine which ones are relevant for each situation and how I should apply them.

Not all of the principles are going to be critical in every situation. But you're probably going to find that five or six, or even seven of them, may apply to your initiative. And so you want to think through each of them, kind of like a check list, to make sure you're thinking about your service in a holistic way. As you do this and you review each of them, you have a way to determine whether or not they're appropriate for your service and should it be applied.

Now, I mentioned a lot about these guiding principles so far but I haven't even told you what they are. Well, throughout the rest of this section we're going to focus on the seven guiding principles. The first is focus on value. The second is start where you are. The third is progress iteratively and with feedback. The fourth is to collaborate and promote visibility. The fifth is to think and work holistically. The sixth is to keep it simple and practical. And finally our seventh one is to optimize and automate.

So, let's get started looking at our seven guiding principles.
