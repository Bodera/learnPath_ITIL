## Four dimensions of service management

In this section of the course, we're going to discuss the four dimensions of service management.

Now as we do this, this is going to relate to the describe the four dimensions of IT Service Management objective from the exam. This is considered a Bloom's level two objective, which means that we're going to have to describe it.

We're not going to be memorizing definitions specifically. But we need to understand how this model works, and how it applies in ITIL.

Now when we talk about the four dimensions of IT Service Management, what we're really talking about is four different perspectives.

So if I have in the center, the value that I'm trying to co-create, I do that by using different products and services that I deliver as a service provider to my consumer or my customer.

Now, the consumer and customer has this product that they want to get value from right? And that means we have to deliver that product or that service.

Now when I go to create a product or service, I look at it from four different perspectives. And these four perspectives are what we call the four dimensions of IT Service Management.

The first one is the organizations and people. The second is information and technology. The third is the partners and suppliers. And the fourth is the value streams and processes.

And all around that they have these external factors you can see around, in the study guide provided, the side that are going to impact the service and products that we're creating as well. Now we're going to talk about each of these four areas, and those external factors throughout the rest of this section.
